# Introduction

OpEnCellS (Open energy cell simulation) is a open-source energy system model for the simulation and optimization of multi energy carrier supply systems. It covers components of the electricity, heat/cold and chemical sector. The tool is written in Python and follows an object-oriented modeling approach. It enables a detailed simulation of various renewable energy technologies, the operation optimization based on a MILP approach and the sizing optimization based on genetic algorithms. The temporal resolution can be flexible defined.

Electricity sector involves models for:

* Photovoltaic
* Wind turbines
* Batteries
* Electricity grid

Heat sector involves models for:

* Heat pump
* Heat storage
* Cold storage
* Heat grid

Chemical sector involves models for:

* Fuel cell
* Electrolyzer
* Hydrogen storage

Further documentation will be updated soon.
