Introduction
============
OpEnCellS (Open energy cell simulation) is a open-source modeling framework for the simulation of multi energy carrier supply systems. 
It covers components of the electricity, heat and chemical sector.
The tool is written in Python and follows an object-oriented modeling approach.
It enables a detailed simulation of various renewable energy technologies with a temporal resolution of one minute or one hour.

Electricity sector involves models for:
 * Photovoltaic
 * Wind turbines
 * Power components
 * Inverter
 * Batteries

Heat sector involves models for:
 * Heat pump
 * Solarthermal
 * Heat storage (perfectly mixed and stratified)

Chemical sector involves models for:
 * Fuel cell
 * Electrolyzer
 * Hydrogen storage
