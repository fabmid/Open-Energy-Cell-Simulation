# Introduction

OpEnCellS (Open energy cell simulation) is a open-source modeling framework for the simulation of multi energy carrier supply systems. It covers components of the electricity, heat/cold and chemical sector. The tool is written in Python and follows an object-oriented modeling approach. It enables a detailed simulation of various renewable energy technologies with a flexible temporal resolution of up to one minute.

Electricity sector involves models for:

* Photovoltaic
* Wind turbines
* Power components
* Inverters
* Batteries

Heat sector involves models for:

* Heat pump
* Solarthermal
* Heat storage (perfectly mixed and stratified)

Chemical sector involves models for:

* Fuel cell
* Electrolyzer
* Hydrogen storage
