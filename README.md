Introduction
============
OpEnCellS (Open energy cell simulation) is a open-source modeling framework for the simulation of energy systems.
The tool is written in Python and follows an object-oriented modeling approach.


OpEnCellS
---------
OpEnCellS enables a detailed powerflow simulation of various renewable energy technologies with a temporal resolution of one minute or one hour.
Electricity sector components involves models for:

 * Photovoltaic
 * Power components
 * Batteries

Power component technologies can be:
 * Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM) charge controller
 * Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) charge controller
 * Battery Management Systems (BMS)
 * Power inverters

Models of heat sector components involve solarthermal collectors, pipes and stratified heat storages, which are currently under development.

To Dos
------
 * Include Installation instructions in file with command "pip install module" or list of necessary external libaries.
